=============================

The class has a variable __expinds that stores the first indices of every experiment.
This has a get method ExperimentHeads().
ExperimentIndices() returns all the indices corresponding to that experiment.

ClusterIndices(n,exper=None) is useful to avoid all the np.where's: returns all the indices corresponding to spikes in the nth cluster. If exper is not None then also returns only the indices belonging to a particular dataset (0,1,...).

PartPlot, Crop and CropCluster now accept a tuple (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) instead of the four arguments separately.

Tidied up in general, changed order of some methods and some names.

Changed "comprehension" to "compression" in "Save", I believe this was a mistake.
