Spike sorting
=============

This code performs fully automated spike sorting on events detected and localised with the interpolating spike detection tools in  the sub-project [postProcessing](../postProcessing) or the development version under [InterpDetectionDev](../InterpDetectionDev).


The full workflow is illustrated in the jupyter notebook [Spike sorting workflow demonstration.ipynb](Spike sorting workflow demonstration.ipynb).

This method was developed by [Martino Sorbaro](http://martinosorb.github.io) and [Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/index.html).
